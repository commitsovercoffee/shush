![](shush.png)

Shush is a minimal website blocker for Firefox that helps you silence distracting
websites. Easily block websites whenever you want, or schedule blocks by time and
day to keep distractions away during work hours. Protect your settings with a password
so only you control what stays blocked. Import and export your blocklist to sync
across devices or share with others.
